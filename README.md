Overview of DISCRETE STRUCTURE
==================================================================================================================================

💁🏻‍♀️ 𝓒𝓸𝓾𝓻𝓼𝓮 𝓼𝔂𝓷𝓸𝓹𝓼𝓲𝓼 💁🏻‍♀️

This course introduces students to the principles and applications of discrete structure in the fieldof computer science. The topics that are covered in this course are set theory, proof techniques,
relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees and finite
automata. At the end of the course, the students should be able to use set theory, relations and
functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems using recurrence
relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees in real world problems and use
deterministic finite automata finite state machines to model electronic devices and problems.

The course covered various topics, including set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. Among these, I found recurrence relations and proof techniques particularly challenging. Additionally, understanding deterministic finite automata and modeling finite state machines expanded my perspective on how electronic devices and systems are designed. Since our assignment 1 came out with many careless mistakes, therefore, for the next three assignments, I'd double-check at least three times to make sure that there are no mistakes made by my group members and also myself.
For improvement, I hope that the content of the slides given could be more detailed and well-explained. Also, the slides or lecturer should give more questions that are at the same level compared with our test since all the questions given in class and slides are simple and direct questions. In order for me to score this course, self-learning is so important for us to understand deeper about certain subtopics.
